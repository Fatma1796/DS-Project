# Data Preparation and Exploration Project

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding the utility of **data preparation** and **exploration techniques** using a dataset chosen from a predefined list. By analyzing and preparing the dataset, we aim to extract meaningful insights and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling. The project also emphasizes the importance of **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **visualization** to understand and interpret the data effectively.

## Tasks and Requirements

### **Dataset Analysis and Preparation**

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Display the first and last 12 rows of the dataset.
   - Identify the total number of rows and columns.
   - List all column names and their data types.
   - Print the name of the first column.
   - Generate a summary of the dataset, including non-null counts and data types.
   - Choose a categorical attribute and display its distinct values.
   - Identify the most frequently occurring value in the categorical attribute.
   - Calculate and present the **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, and **percentiles** for a numerical attribute.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Filter rows based on a specific condition of your choice.
   - Count records where an attribute starts with a specific letter.
   - Identify and remove duplicate rows.
   - Convert a numerical column's data type (e.g., integer to string).
   - Group data by two categorical features and analyze the results.
   - Check for missing values and replace them with the **median** or **mode** as appropriate.
   - Divide a numerical column into 5 equal-width bins and count the records in each bin.
   - Identify and print the row corresponding to the maximum value of a numerical feature.
   - Create a **boxplot**, **histogram**, and **scatterplot** for selected attributes and justify their relevance.
   - Normalize numerical attributes using **StandardScaler**.
   - Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dataset to two components and visualize the data before and after PCA.
   - Analyze correlations between numerical features using a heatmap.

### **Practical Analytical Questions**

- Calculate and display the **correlation matrix** to identify relevant features for classification.
- Find the class distribution of a selected categorical feature and analyze the results.
- Perform **feature engineering** by creating new features from existing ones and explain their significance.
